# jepsen.etcd

Jepsen tests for the etcd consensus system! To run these, you'll need a [Jepsen
cluster](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen). Then, in the standard tests,
run:

## Usage

To run a full test suite, run

```sh
lein run test-all --concurrency 2n
```

You can focus in on particular combinations of faults, or particular workloads:

```sh
lein run test-all --concurrency 2n --workload lock
lein run test-all --concurrency 2n --nemesis kill,partition
```

You can also run particular workloads and nemeses with `lein run test`. For instance, to demonstrate lost updates to a set protected by an etcd lock, try:

```sh
lein run test --workload lock-set --nemesis pause --time-limit 120
```
